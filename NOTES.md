- Javascript used with CommonJS syntax
- sizes.json and cards.json have the same content, so I created a new sizes-m.json file containing size objects.

Given more time, I would: 
- implement more robust error handling
- create a util lookup function to retrieve imageUrl and sizes
- use express router
